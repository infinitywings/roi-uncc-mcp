# AI-Assisted Grid Attack Scenario Demonstrations

This guide demonstrates how AI can coordinate sophisticated cyber attacks on power grid infrastructure using real-world inspired scenarios.

## Available Attack Scenarios

### 1. Ukraine-Inspired Multi-Stage Attack
**File**: `config/ukraine_inspired_attack.yaml`

Based on the 2015 Ukraine power grid attacks where adversaries:
- Gained SCADA system access via spear-phishing
- Remotely opened circuit breakers at 30 substations
- Changed passwords to lock out operators
- Disrupted power to 225,000 customers

**Demo Adaptation**:
- Phase 1: Reconnaissance to map grid topology
- Phase 2: Voltage manipulation (simulating SCADA control)
- Phase 3: Load stress attacks
- Phase 4: Command blocking (simulating lockout)

### 2. Aurora-Inspired Generator Attack
**File**: `config/aurora_inspired_attack.yaml`

Based on the 2007 Aurora vulnerability demonstration showing cyber-physical damage:
- Rapid breaker operations causing generator desynchronization
- Physical damage from mechanical stress

**Demo Adaptation**:
- Rapid voltage oscillations
- Oscillating load injections
- Protection system bypass

### 3. Coordinated Substation Attack
**File**: `config/coordinated_substation_attack.yaml`

A practical scenario demonstrating coordinated attacks on multiple distribution substations:
- Simultaneous multi-point attacks
- Phase-specific targeting
- Cascading failure induction
- Recovery prevention

## Running the Demonstrations

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure the grid simulation is running:
```bash
# Start the full demo environment
./run_demo.sh --docker --build
```

2. Or manually start the components:
```bash
# Start Docker containers
docker compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up -d

# Verify all services are running
docker compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml ps
```

### Execute Attack Scenarios

#### Option 1: Ukraine-Inspired Attack (5 minutes)
```bash
python3 demo_attack_scenario.py --scenario config/ukraine_inspired_attack.yaml
```

This demonstrates:
- How reconnaissance identifies critical nodes
- Strategic voltage manipulation at key points
- Load injection to amplify stress
- Command blocking to prevent recovery

#### Option 2: Aurora-Inspired Attack (3 minutes)
```bash
python3 demo_attack_scenario.py --scenario config/aurora_inspired_attack.yaml
```

This demonstrates:
- Rapid oscillating attacks
- Cyber-physical impact concepts
- Generator bus targeting

#### Option 3: Coordinated Substation Attack (4 minutes)
```bash
python3 demo_attack_scenario.py --scenario config/coordinated_substation_attack.yaml
```

This demonstrates:
- Multi-point coordination
- Phase imbalance attacks
- Cascading failure patterns

### Interactive Monitoring

While the attack is running, you can monitor the grid state in another terminal:

```bash
# Watch grid status updates
watch -n 1 'curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/status | jq .'

# Or continuously monitor specific metrics
while true; do 
    curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/status | jq '.grid_state.voltages'
    sleep 2
done
```

### Understanding the Output

The demo will show:

1. **Attack Planning**: AI's strategic reasoning
2. **Execution Log**: Each attack with parameters and timing
3. **Impact Metrics**: Voltage deviations, power disruptions
4. **Campaign Summary**: Total effectiveness scores

### Analyzing Results

Results are saved to `demo_results/` with detailed logs:

```bash
# List all scenario results
ls -la demo_results/scenario_*.json

# Analyze a specific result
cat demo_results/scenario_Coordinated_Distribution_Substation_Attack_*.json | jq '.result.metrics'

# Compare with random attacks
./run_demo.sh --mode comparison --config config/coordinated_substation_attack.yaml
```

### Key Observations

When running these demos, observe:

1. **Strategic Planning**: How AI identifies vulnerabilities
2. **Attack Coordination**: Timing and sequencing of attacks
3. **Adaptive Behavior**: How AI adjusts based on grid response
4. **Impact Amplification**: Cascading effects from coordinated attacks
5. **Recovery Denial**: How command blocking extends disruption

### Creating Custom Scenarios

You can create your own scenarios by copying and modifying the YAML files:

```yaml
scenario:
  name: "Custom Attack Scenario"
  description: "Your attack description"
  target_grid: "2bus-13bus"
  duration: 300

attack_strategy:
  objective: "Define the attack goal"
  phases:
    - name: "Phase 1"
      description: "What happens first"
      duration: 60

ai:
  system_prompt: "Guide the AI's approach"

attack:
  initial_prompt: "Specific instructions for the AI"
```

### Safety and Ethics

These demonstrations are for **defensive security research only**:
- All attacks are confined to the simulation
- Safety limits prevent damage to the simulation
- Results help develop better grid defenses
- Knowledge assists in threat assessment and mitigation

### Troubleshooting

If attacks aren't executing:

1. Check MCP server is running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/status
```

2. Verify HELICS federation:
```bash
docker logs helics-broker
docker logs gridpack-federate
docker logs gridlabd-federate
```

3. Check AI connectivity:
```bash
# For local LLM
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/models

# Check MCP server logs
docker logs mcp-server
```

### Advanced Usage

For research comparisons:

```bash
# Run AI vs Random comparison for any scenario
./run_demo.sh --mode comparison --duration 300 --trials 5

# Use different AI models
python3 demo_attack_scenario.py --scenario config/ukraine_inspired_attack.yaml \
  --ai-model gpt-4 --ai-base-url https://api.openai.com/v1 --ai-api-key sk-xxx

# Adjust attack constraints
# Edit the scenario YAML file's attack section
```

## Summary

These demonstrations show how AI can:
1. **Plan** sophisticated multi-stage attacks
2. **Coordinate** multiple attack vectors
3. **Adapt** to grid responses in real-time
4. **Maximize** impact through strategic timing
5. **Prevent** recovery through denial tactics

This research helps grid operators understand emerging threats and develop appropriate defenses against AI-assisted cyber attacks.
